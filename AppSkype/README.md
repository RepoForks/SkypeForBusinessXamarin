    <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3a3257c7-473a-4790-9610-9a561eed0b8c%20The%20Skype%20SDK%20.aar%20files%20have%20been%20added%20manually.%20Some%20dependency%20have%20been%20added%20via%20Nuget%20(Compact.V4,%20Compact.V7">https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3a3257c7-473a-4790-9610-9a561eed0b8c </a>
</p>

<h4>RESULT </h4>
